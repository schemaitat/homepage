# About me

My mathematical journey began in 2012 in Nijmegen at the Radboud University, where I have been mainly influenced by A. C. M. van Rooij, Peter Hochs and Jens Kaad. Thanks to Jens I found my way into the beautiful world of non-commutative geometry. In 2020 I finished my doctoral studies under the supervision of Wilhelm Winter at the Univerisy of Münster. Here, I did my research in the field of [C*-algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C*-algebra), a subject which has its origins in quantum machanics. 

After that I started a position at [Atruvia AG](https://atruvia.de/) in Münster, where I was resposible for migrating a z/OS batch application to OpenShift. Furthermore, I researched on new methods to make AML solution more efficient and accurate.

At Atruvia, I also developed a strong interest in automation, distributed computing, kubernetes, linux, machine learning and how you can combine these things in a meaningful way.

Currently, I work as Senior Data Scientist at [flaschenpost SE](https://www.flaschenpost.de/). Using machine learning, we try to make the last mile delivery as efficient as possible.

In my free time I also like to work on my Raspberry Pi (kubernetes cluster) and learning new things related to the mathematics of machine learning, CS, Data Science and new programming languages like Julia.
