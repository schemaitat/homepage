# About me

My mathematical journey began in 2012 in Nijmegen at the Radboud University, where I have been mainly influenced by A. C. M. van Rooij, Peter Hochs and Jens Kaad. Thanks to Jens I found my way into the beautiful world of non-commutative geometry. In 2020 I finished my doctoral studies under the supervision of Wilhelm Winter at the Univerisy of Münster. Here, I did my research in the field of [C*-algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C*-algebra), a subject which has its origins in quantum machanics. 

After that I started my recent position at [Atruvia AG](https://atruvia.de/) in Münster, where I use my analytical mindset to find new concepts in the realm of AML (Anti Money Laundering). 

At Atruvia, I also developed a strong interest in automation, distributed computing, kubernetes, linux, machine learning and how you can combine these things in a meaningful way.

In my free time I also like to work on my Raspberry Pi kubernetes cluster (thanks [Jeff Geerling](https://www.jeffgeerling.com) for having me infected).
